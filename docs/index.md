# Programming Languages Course Introduction<br/> Kenjiro Taura {.unnumbered}

# What's new

* <font color=blue>Blue letters in the beginning of a line</font> is the day the announcement was made
* <font color=red>Please reload the page</font> frequently as it will be updated during the course.

* <font color=blue>(2025/04/29)</font> 
  * I made a OneDrive folder for each team
  * You can access that folder via
    * Course Materials section (or Information "Language and workplace assignments are out") [UTOL course page](https://utol.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=2025_0340_FEN-EE4d19L1_01) 
    * -> Common OneDrive Folder `programming-languages-shared`, shared by everybody 
    * -> `teaming/teams.xlsx` Excel book
    * -> link to the folder for each team is in `05-08` tab
  * Use the `team-info.xlsx` in your folder to exchange your contact info
  
* <font color=blue>(2025/04/28)</font> Plan for April 28th
  1. Wrap up [Functional Programming Basics](slides/01-functional.pdf)
  1. Briefly explains [Object-Oriented Programming](slides/02-oop.pdf)
  1. Team members meet and greet
  1. Work on `pl03_oop_basics` briefly
  1. Continue [Object-Oriented Programming](slides/02-oop.pdf)
* <font color=blue>(2025/04/27)</font> Your language and workplace assignments are out
  * Those who have submitted language preference survey should be able to see your assignment (as it contains personal infomration, it is visible only to those who have submitted it) in onedrive.  Get the link in the information or course materials section of [UTOL course page](https://utol.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=2025_0340_FEN-EE4d19L1_01)
  * Please check your assigned language (go/julia/ocaml/rust) and suggested workplace (classroom or home)
  * I have made teams so that either all members in a team work in classroom or all members in zoom
  * _Therefore it is important to follow your suggested workplace_
  * Those who said "you always or almost always work in classroom (or zoom)" are assigned to the respective workplace you preferred
  * Among those who said "you are flexible (can work either in classroom or zoom)", two of those are assigned to zoom, and all others are assigned to classroom
  * Some facts about the overall "happiness" (how much of your preference has been satisfied)
    * 57 students have been grouped into 15 teams (12 x 4-member teams + 3 x 3-member teams)
    * If you specified the friends you wanted to team up with, your wishes were 100% honored
    * How many students were assigned to the language they ranked at each position:
      * 1st: 43
      * 2nd: 11
      * 3rd: 1
      * 4th: 2
    * If you are assigned to the language you preferred 4th, it is because you specified three friends and everybody in the team ranked that language 4th (no way to avoid them)
    * If you are assigned the language you preferred 3rd, it is because of a slightly different but similar situation
* <font color=blue>(2025/04/20)</font> Plan for April 21st
  1. Work on `pl01_basics` for 10 minutes and briefly review answers in [spreadsheet](https://univtokyo-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/2615215597_utac_u-tokyo_ac_jp/EX7tccfLFB5FmwT-gVGyzykBPX8QjSyo6lnxfKHn0qXh4Q?e=5BXr0M)
  1. [Functional Programming Basics](slides/01-functional.pdf)
  1. Work on `pl02_fp_basics`, and share your answers in the same [spreadsheet](https://univtokyo-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/2615215597_utac_u-tokyo_ac_jp/EX7tccfLFB5FmwT-gVGyzykBPX8QjSyo6lnxfKHn0qXh4Q?e=5BXr0M)
  1. Until the end of today's class, answer [language preference survey](https://forms.office.com/r/qnR50JQ6ZS)
     - <font color="red">Update after the class:</font> I will start grouping wednesday.  Please submit your survey no later than <font color="red">23:59, April 22nd</font>
* <font color=blue>(2025/04/20)</font> Lecture recordings available from the "Course Materials" section of [UTOL course page](https://utol.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=2025_0340_FEN-EE4d19L1_01)
* <font color=blue>(2025/03/29)</font> Home page for AY2025 is out. Welcome!
* <font color=blue>(2025/03/29)</font> We use PC during the class. Bring your device.
* <font color=blue>(2025/03/29)</font> We are going to use Jupyter environment for your work. See [How to access Jupyter environment](html/jupyter.html?lang=en)
* <font color=blue>(2025/03/29)</font> Your user name and password will be distributed via UTOL (see [How to access Jupyter environment](html/jupyter.html?lang=en) above). They are sent to the following people, so please make sure you will be included.
  * Those who already registered to this course via [UTAS](https://utas.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) _before yesterday_
  * Those who bookmarked this course in [UTAS](https://utas.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) _before yesterday_
  * Those who self-registered yourself, by pressing the "register a course" button on the upper right of the [UTOL course page](https://utol.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=2025_0340_FEN-EE4d19L1_01) _before around 9:30AM today_.  I will add those who did it later than that during the class.
    * note: registering to UTOL does not mean you register to the course for credit, which has to be done via [UTAS](https://utas.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/). If you want to join the first day but haven't decided to take the course for credit, use this UTOL option.
* <font color=blue>(2025/03/29)</font> Plan for the first day (April 7th)

  1. Answer a [survey](https://forms.office.com/r/pXQ5WbvgBJ) during the class today (before 11:45AM if possible)
  1. Play with Jupyter; use `pl00_intro` to practice submitting your work, in [Jupyter](html/jupyter.html?lang=en) and [UTOL](https://utol.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=2025_0340_FEN-EE4d19L1_01) (Assignment 01 : `pl00_intro`)
    * Don't forget to play with the AI tutor in `pl00_intro/pl00_tutor.sos`
  1. Work on `pl01_basics`. Please share answer in this [spreadsheet](https://univtokyo-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/2615215597_utac_u-tokyo_ac_jp/EX7tccfLFB5FmwT-gVGyzykBPX8QjSyo6lnxfKHn0qXh4Q?e=5BXr0M) after 11:15AM (whoever comes first)
  1. Submit a Reflective Essay to [UTOL](https://utol.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=2025_0340_FEN-EE4d19L1_01) after every lecture (due the next day).
* (optional) There is a UTokyo Slack / EEIC workspace / `#2025s-programming-languages` channel for mutual help on this course
  * To join it, find the [EEIC: 工学部 電子情報工学科・電気電子工学科](https://utokyo-eeic.slack.com) workspace (public) from the [UTokyo Slack directory page](https://utokyo.enterprise.slack.com/), join the workspace (anybody with access to UTokyo Slack can join the workspace), and then to the channel
  * For general instruction and prerequisites on UTokyo Slack, see [Joining an open workspace in UTokyo Slack](https://utelecon.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/slack/join) in utelecon (or Google "utokyo slack"); in particular, [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://utelecon.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/utokyo_account/mfa/) is mandatory; if you haven't done it yet, do it later, not during the lecture
* How to reach me?
  * UTOL message
  * Email (`tau at eidos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp`)
