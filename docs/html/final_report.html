the Term Report (2025)</h1>
<h1 data-number="1" id="evaluation-criteria"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Evaluation Criteria</h1>
<ul>
<li>The conditions for the credit are the following condition #0-#3
<ul>
<li>condition #0: participate in the class and submit reflective essays
sufficient number of times</li>
<li>condition #1: engage in group work sufficiently</li>
<li>condition #2: submit assignments in UTOL
<ul>
<li>Assignment 2 (<code>pl03_oop_basics</code>),</li>
<li>Assignment 3 (<code>pl05_generic_fun_type</code>), and</li>
<li>Assignment 4 (yet to come, about memory management)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>condition #3: submit the term report (option A-C)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="2" id="the-term-report"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> The Term Report</h1>
<ul>
<li>One of the following options A, B, or C</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="option-a-build-a-compiler"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Option A (build a
compiler)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finish code generator in the MinC (minimum subset of C) compiler
construction exercise (detailed spec and base code will be announced
soon). The following baseline code and test code will be given
<ul>
<li>lexical analyzer and parser (code that reads the source
program)</li>
<li>definition of syntax tree (data structure you get after reading the
source program)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What you need to submit is “heavily commented code.” Write comments
with the mindset of writing down the workings of the code generator. You
should write those comments as if you are writing a “document” for
others to read, except that they are embedded within the code</li>
<li>The submission is evaluated with criterion including
<ul>
<li>the level of accomplishment (how many tests you passed),</li>
<li>the quality of the code and documentation of the code
generator,</li>
<li>and additional advanced topics you achieved (optimization, exension
(for statement, floating point numbers, pointers, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="option-b-apply-to-your-project"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Option B (apply to your
project)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Apply what you’ve learned in this lecture or what you recently
learned about programming languages to your bachelor thesis research or
other ongoing projects (or conduct a development or an experiment
hopefully useful for it). Here are some examples, among others.</p>
</p></li>
<li><p>Use OCaml, Julia, Go, or Rust to develop programs you need to
develop in your bachelor thesis or other research projects, to the end
of enhancing their quality. Attempts to enhance their functionality
and/or robustness thanks to the programability of such languages.
Investigate their advantages or shortages you learned through the
experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider which topics are most useful to your future task and
conduct an experiment or development at least one step deeper than the
exercises of the lecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Expected contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>research being conducted or planned</li>
<li>the goal you set this time, toward the end of using it in your
research</li>
<li>programs you developed and/or experiments you conducted</li>
<li>results</li>
<li>discussion and your thoughts</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I mentioned connection to your bachelor thesis research or other
projects several times above; I did so in the hope that you can use your
time most effectively and profitably; I do not have any intention to
narrow the range of topics you can choose from. If you have a topic of
your interest but have no relevant projects you may apply it to or think
your projects are too far from it, never mind and choose the topic you
are interested in.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="option-c-read-a-paper"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Option C (read a paper)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Based on what you have learned in this lecture, read a related paper
in English and summarize it with your own thought.</li>
<li>Expected contents:
<ul>
<li>The purpose of your reading the paper: What did you try to learn
from the paper? (not just to “write the report”)</li>
<li>Summary of the paper (bear in mind that it is not just a
translation. Imagine you are writing an article in another magazine
introducing the paper)</li>
<li>The value of the paper, in your own thoughts and terms</li>
<li>Other thoughts, including constructive criticism or what you think
should follow this paper, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I don’t put an upper bound on the length; the minimum is three
pages.</li>
<li>I especially look forward to researches on program code generation
using large language models</li>
<li>A few recommended venues to search for papers (but not limited to
them)
